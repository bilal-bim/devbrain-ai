## 3. Problem Statement

**Current State**: Founders struggle with the gap between having an idea and creating a technical implementation. Existing solutions either focus purely on business planning (without technical guidance) or require significant technical expertise.

**Key Problems**:
1. **Specification Gap**: 67% of development projects fail due to unclear requirements
2. **Context Loss**: Technical specifications are often disconnected from business strategy
3. **Communication Breakdown**: Founders and developers speak different languages
4. **Iteration Inefficiency**: Changes require rewriting extensive documentation
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Business intelligence stays with founders, technical knowledge with developers
